    OAuth (preferred)
    OAuth is the preferred authentication mechanism for both web and installed apps. Using the scope https://www.google.com/reader/api/ obtain a request token, authorize it, exchange it for an access token, and make requests as usual, passing in the OAuth token in the Authorization: HTTP header. You may find the OAuth Playground useful in experimenting with all this.

    The https://www.google.com/reader/atom/ and https://www.google.com/reader/subscription/export scopes are supported as well for applications wish to use the Atom and OPML outputs. Additionally, HTTP versions of these HTTPS schemes are also available.

"sharing (broadcast tag)"
apparently there are two tags "broadcast" and "broadcast-friends"

As far as unsharing goes, you can use an edit-tag request to remove
the broadcast tag as you would for any other item. We don't currently
support editing of the note once it's created.

There is also the concept of "notes" in Reader, which are standalone
items that originate purely within Reader (you can see the UI for them
at the top of Your Shared Items, Your Stuff, and People You Follow).
These have an origin stream of user/-/state/com.google/post. They can
also be deleted (in the UI they have a delete action) but I don't
remember off-hand the URL for that.
