Before that happens, I'll release a new version of FeedDemon that removes those features."

Shareaholic: a "share this on X" (on steroids) browser plugin for the 6 major browsers
http://www.shareaholic.com/

RSS Share: a Chrome extension that implements pretty much the G+/Reader integration we actually wanted:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cngpndgifehgejmkemnmmiknpafnhpec
  "RSS Share for Google Plus™ and Google Reader™ is an extension that does two things:
  * Adds a Google Reader section to the Google Plus homepage
  * Adds a "Share on Google+" button on Google Reader
  This way, whether you mainly use Google Reader or Google Plus you can keep up with current events and webpages and instantly share them if you feel like it."

One-click OPML export: (an XML list of all your subscribed feeds)
http://www.dataliberation.org/google/reader

Reverse Engineering Reader

I'm poking around and reverse engineering the Reader system, mostly just to understand how to fix it when their data export solution inevitably doesn't work right. But also I've got a half-baked idea to write a Sharebro Reader on my own. Or maybe a Chrome Extension that adds a Share button etc. back in to the new lobotomized FrankenReader, maybe using Disqus or Facebook for comments.

Google currently provides a way to pull someone's shared items as a JSON or Atom feed. For instance, here's mine:

http://www.google.com/reader/public/javascript/user/15504357426492542506/state/com.google/broadcast
http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/15504357426492542506/state/com.google/broadcast

(I can't find or figure out the *RSS* url but there must be one, right?)

It seems to only go back a few days, sadly.

How to find someone's google id and feed url? For me, it (and the above atom link) is inside http://www.google.com/reader/shared/alexch -- view source and look for

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user%2F15504357426492542506%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fbroadcast" title="Alex Chaffee&#39;s shared items" id="auto-discovery">

So http://google.com/profiles/alexch now redirects to my Plus Posts page -- which, btw, WTF?!?! -- where I have a *totally different* user id in the excruciating url https://plus.google.com/u/0/107397735779828096052/posts. How to find the link between the two ids?

The atom feed code is interesting. My Note comes through as a tag in the "gr" namespace:

    <gr:annotation>
    <content type="html">
    So writing code on an iOS device doesn't violate Apple's TOS?
    </content>
    <author gr:user-id="15504357426492542506" gr:profile-id="107397735779828096052">
    <name>Alex Chaffee</name>
    </author>
    </gr:annotation>

in the "author" tag are two ids -- one is my "user id" and one is my "profile id" -- and it looks like "user id" is the one I found before and "profile id" is the same as my plus id (the one in the long annoying G+ url).

Notably, my Notes are in the feed, but others' Comments are nowhere to be found. There's a "comments":[] entry in the JSON but it's always empty.

I found some more links describing the *still undocumented and unofficial* Reader API. I'll check through those later on. It looks like comments are accessible.

Shorter me: "We'll be retiring some social features from GMail since they duplicate Google Plus functionality. But don't worry, you'll still be able to to reply and forward by using Send To and Circles!"

My thoughts (which I reserve the right to update at will):

Without "Comment View" Google Reader is just an ugly way to read blogs. I want to read *articles* not entire blog feeds. Which articles? Those selected for me by my friends. Which friends? Those I discovered through their Reader comments.

Here's how we use Reader: mostly we open Comment View and read only the articles Noted or Commented by our friends. Then we read our own feeds of blogs, and if we find something we like, we share it. We share it because *we want to know what our friends think* about it. In fact those comments are usually the most important thing, so we open Comment View *the next time we use Reader*.

All that is going bye-bye. Or unless I see a mockup or preview or usability flowchart to the contrary, I must assume so.

Reader is my second inbox. GMail is my first. All the rest (Twitter, Facebook, Plus) are mere streams; raging torrents into which I occasionally dip a toe.

When I post something on my Tumblr blog -- usually a quote or a short comment -- I'm pretty sure nobody will see it. When I then *share* that post on Reader, I'm doing so because I *know* a few dozen of my actual friends *will actually read it*, because it's important to me and I've chosen to *Share* it, not just post it.

The genesis of Plus was an attempt to clone Facebook mixed with an overreaction to the privacy sh-tstorm of Buzz, which in turn was an attempt to clone Twitter. They have no idea how people use Reader -- it's a curated feed *producer* and *aggregator* and reader, with built in comment threads and friend discovery -- so I expect they have no idea how to migrate features to a totally different product with different goals and users. 

Does Plus emit RSS per user? Does it emit an aggregate RSS feed of a given circle? 

What about my "Awesome" list, containing the blogs *and friends' feeds* I know I must read, as opposed to the hundreds of others I subscribe to for when I have time?

What about Shift-S to share? If I have to click on "Send To", then wait for a menu, then scan it for a "Plus" icon, then click that, then whoops, now I have to select some circles... well, then I probably just won't.

Plus, G+ Circles are pointing in the wrong direction for a social feed mediator. I publish to *topics*, not to *people*. Who has time to curate a list of lists of hundreds of subscribers? And why not let them decide? That's one reason why Twitter's Follow model works -- you have a public face, whom anyone can subscribe to, and optionally a private face, where you have to approve.

I would also add that Reader has at least partially solved the Annotation Problem that has bedeviled the Web since at least 1996. Many startups have been sacrificed upon that altar.

Now it looks like Google Plus was/is already integrated with Google Reader. Clicking on "View this shared item in Google Buzz" goes to a posts page in Plus with comments that sync back and forth between Plus and Reader. Which is exactly what we've been asking for viz. Reader/Plus integration. 

So they did what we wanted, then they buried it in a Buzz menu and didn't tell us, and now they're removing it from Reader altogether? Maddening!

"One of Brian's complaints is that it's a lot more difficult to share a post in the new interface. Instead of clicking "Share" or using a keyboard shortcut, you now have to click "+1", then click "Share on Google+", select your audience and then click the "Share" button. There's also a privacy downside: +1's are public, even if you only want to share a post with one or two people. Fortunately, there's a way to share a post without first clicking +1, but it's not obvious. Just use the "share" box from Google's navigation bar."

http://siliconfilter.com/dont-like-the-new-google-reader-here-are-three-alternatives/ : "Today, Google launched the largest update to Google Reader in a long time.

Reader’s social features, for example, are now almost completely gone. You also can’t bundle a set of feeds and share them with friends anymore, just like you can’t share comments about stories with your friends in Google Reader." -- not clear if any of those three alternatives contain those features

"New feed readers need to be extendable, and an API is a must. Curation tools are missing. I want to have my discovery chain encoded and transmitted every time I share something. I want to know if I am making an impact. A new feed reader with these features could be almost like a gamification of feed reading. I don’t share because I know people are reading what I say, it just makes it more fun. If such a tool existed, I am sure it would have a huge uptake with RSS addicts, which could have a large network effect, because the people who consume RSS are also the people most likely to transmit cool, new things."  -

-- echoes my point that circles point the wrong way, plus a good list of alternative RSS Reading and Sharing solutions, and points out that "the changes seem to have removed most of the value from the service for me, so I'm moving on as I was invited to do" and use services like pinboard more, instead of plus

John Montgomery: "not being able to share and read shares in a unified manner is a deal breaker. I shared 6-8 items a day and read 20-30 from my friends. Those shares? Gold. Every single one of them. Now it's all gone. These changes destroy the only part of the internet I gave a damn about." -- comment on https://plus.google.com/100535338638690515335/posts/95ZsWiCG3xS

"Why Curated Content Matters: A Lament for Reader Share"

(syndicated at Wired http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/11/why-curated-content-matters-a-lament-for-reader-share/ )
"If you used Reader Share, you’re probably in mourning today. No longer can you click the share button at the bottom of a post in your Reader, sending it to a sidebar widget on your blog and popping it into the “people you follow” section of your friends on Reader. No longer can you count on that easy click in Reader to show you the links shared by the people you follow — those trusted curators of content whose taste and judgment you rely on."

"social media outlets [like Twitter and Facebook] are INFO COLANDERS! 5% of your followers will see anything you post, and that's probably only within 20 minutes of posting"

Google+ tip for Google Reader users.

On Google Reader, you can use the Share box in the upper right corner of the screen to share content, in addition to the +1 button in the bottom left of the Reader entry. This allows you to share without having to +1 something, and also preloads a snippet of the article you're looking at.
